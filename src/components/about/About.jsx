      <h3 className="about-headers">My Journey and Interests</h3>
      <p className="about-content">
        My Christian faith is central to my life, guiding my decisions and
        purpose. I have been happily married to Carly since May 2022, and we
        live near Philadelphia with our pup, Brody, who joined our family in
        2024. I am passionate about traveling and Philadelphia sports. As a
        former high school teacher, I have had the opportunity to explore
        amazing places like Glacier National Park, the Great Wall of China, and
        northern Thailand, which have deepened my appreciation for diverse
        cultures.

      <h3 className="about-headers">Why Software Development?</h3>
      <p className="about-content">
        I have always been drawn to creativity and logical problem-solving, so
        when a friend suggested I explore software development, it felt like a
        perfect fit. Since diving into the field, I have developed a passion for
        debugging challenges and designing cutting-edge websites. I am inspired
        by the vast opportunities for learning and growth in software
        development and am eager to apply my skills to meaningful projects as I
        continue to explore this dynamic industry.
