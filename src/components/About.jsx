        <h3 className="about-headers">My Journey and Interests</h3>
        <p className="about-content">
          My Christian faith is central to my life, guiding my decisions and
          purpose. I've been happily married to Carly since May 2022, and we
          live near Philadelphia with our pup, Brody, who joined our family in
          2024. I'm passionate about traveling and Philadelphia sports. As a
          former high school teacher, I've had the chance to explore amazing
          places like Glacier National Park, the Great Wall of China, and
          northern Thailand, which have deepened my appreciation for diverse
          cultures.

        <h3 className="about-headers">Why Software Development?</h3>
        <p className="about-content">
          I've always been drawn to creativity and logical problem-solving, so
          when a friend suggested I explore software development, it felt like a
          perfect fit. Since diving into the field, Iâ€™ve developed a passion for
          debugging challenges and designing cutting-edge websites. I'm inspired
          by the vast opportunities for learning and growth in software
          development and am eager to apply my skills to meaningful projects as
          I continue to explore this dynamic industry.
